## Guidelines
In order to place yout objects and component the right way, you have always to keep in mind the ready pattern of your user. 2 types of patterns can be encountered: F and Z.

### The F reading pattern

In the F-shaped scanning pattern is characterized by many fixations concentrated at the top and the left side of the page.

Users first read in a horizontal movement, usually across the upper part of the content area. He will then
move down the page a bit and then read across in a second horizontal movement that typically covers a shorter area than the previous movement. This additional element forms the F’s lower bar.

The main interaction should then be aligned on the left.

### The Z reading pattren

The z-pattern layout follows the shape of the letter Z. A z-pattern design traces the route the human eye travels when they scan the page— left to right, top to bottom.

Users first read in a horizontal movement, usually across the upper part of the content area then 
down and to the left side of the page, creating a diagonal line and back across to the right again, forming a second horizontal line.

The main interaction should then be aligned on the left.

### Placement of buttons

Buttons in dialog windows should in most cases be placed in the bottom right corner and supplemental actions should be placed on the oppsite side of the dialog than the main button group.
